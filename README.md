# RFID_Reader

# How to install:
  Connect the arduino Mega (of with the help of the pinout guide an other arduino, change a couple of values or it won't work)
  to the RFID-module, download the program and upload it to your arduino. Run the program and open the serial monitor

# How to use it:
  If its uploaded to your connect something to the alarm and controller pin, in my case these go to an alarmmodule and a controller, one
  deactivates the alarm and the otherone activates the alarm. For this example you can use leds. 
  Present a card to the reader to see the values of that card, and write them down in the program, first value in the upper row, second in   the other row
  Reupload the code, and your card will be recoised by the program
  
# Serial monitor
  Using the serial monitor there is a posibilty to see the values, and change the behavioir of the outputs from the arduino, the functions 
  explane themselfs

# How it works:
  The working of the program is explaned within the program, if you have any questions about it leave me a command
